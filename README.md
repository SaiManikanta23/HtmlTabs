# HtmlTabs
Simple Html page containing Tabs and select on click load content

--> This code helps for creating Html Tabs and also loading the content in html on selection in one of the tab

--> Inside the first html tab, there are select options which are again loaded from java script datasource dynamically

--> the content loaded in each of the tab select option is purely dynamically from data source elements

--> Styling of tabs can be easily changes using css

--> If in case new select options in dropdownn to be added , just add the option fields under select tab for the content of the select option, add the content in javascript datasource to_display array as input with ''.

--> The other tab just contains plain text. If the same type of select field to be added in other tab, please change the class values as they shouldn't be same. If the class names are similiar for select and display div's the functionality might not work as java script fails to load proper content for each of the same actions and you may find mis match of loaded objects.
